# Git Assignment - patelj14

a. What is an issue?
 
 An issue is a tool in githib for communicating problems, ideas and decisions that are project specific. 

b. What is a pull request?

A pull request is a request to push the changes you've made in your assignment branch to the main (master) branch.  

c. How do I open up a pull request?

You can open a pull request by going to github and go to the repository you are working on. There is a button called "Pull requests" within github to see the pull requests and then you can click on the commits and look at the comments made during the push. If you want to open the pull request in VS Code, you can go to the branch and then use git log to see the commits made and can see the comments.

3. Go to Settings
4. Click on Access -> Collaborators
5. Manage access --> Add People

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?

GitHub is a website that stores and tracks (hosting repository) changes to coding projects and allows you to collaborate with other individuals. git is a version control tool that we install on the local computer to be able to read, write and delete code/files and push/pull those changes to github. 

f. What does git diff do?

g. What is the main branch?

The main branch is your production branch where you keep the most steady state code and the most approved versions of your code for each file. 

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?

No, you should be creating another branch and make changes to that other branch instead of main. This will allow you to work and update the project on the 'assignment' branch and lets you test your code and once it is tested and verified to do what you intended it to do, you can push your code to the main.
